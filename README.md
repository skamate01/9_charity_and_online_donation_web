Welcome to the "Charity and Online Donation" project repository! This project is aimed at developing a web application that facilitates online donations for various charitable causes. The application is built using HTML, CSS for front-end design, PHP for server-side logic, and SQL for database management.

Project Overview
The purpose of this web application is to create a user-friendly platform that allows users to browse and donate to different charitable initiatives. Users can explore various causes, view details about each charity, and securely make online donations. The system also provides an admin interface for managing charities, donations, and other aspects of the platform.

Technologies Used
HTML and CSS: The front-end of the application is designed using HTML for markup and CSS for styling, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
PHP: The server-side logic is implemented using PHP, handling user requests, processing donation transactions, and interacting with the database.
SQL (MySQL): The project utilizes a MySQL database to store and manage information about charities, users, and donations.
